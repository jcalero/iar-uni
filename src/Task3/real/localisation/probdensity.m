%PROBDENSITY returns the probability density of a N-dimensional normal

%   the measurement is a N-dimensional vector.  the function calculates the
%   probability density of the 'real measurement' of a particle (the value 
%   that the sensor would measure if there were no error) within a N-d normal
%   distribuition with mean=sensor measure
